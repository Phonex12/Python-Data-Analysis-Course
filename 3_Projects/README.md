Welcome to the Data Job Postings Analysis project! This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing data-related job postings to uncover trends, in-demand skills, geographic distributions, salary ranges, and more.

## Overview
This project aims to help job seekers, recruiters, and data science enthusiasts understand the current landscape of data-related jobs by leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to answer important questions such as:

**What skills are most sought after in data job postings?**

**Which locations offer the most opportunities?**

**How do job titles and roles vary across companies?**
